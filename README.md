# FE2TAS - Game

This project is an open-source recreation inspired by the Roblox game [Flood Escape 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/586645082/Flood-Escape-2) and [8y8x's FE2CM Sandbox map](https://youtu.be/pTBZKNg4k8g). Developed with [Roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/) and [Rojo](https://rojo.space/), it is a game revolving around **Tool Assisted Speedrunning** designed to bring back the popular TAS scripts from 2022.

## Features
There are a plethora of features, Most of which I have taken from 8y8x's model.
- #**Collision:**
  - **Fully sandboxed:** By the map being 'fully sandbox', it allows for full eventscript / eventstring / timelines emulation.
  - **Cloud saving:** This allows for alot less downtime, as it doesn't rely on Roblox's unreliable datastore to store TAS runs, and allows for easy run sharing.
  - **Full Physics:** This game fully & accurately recreates the older Flood Escape 2 physics, allowing for backjumping & wallhopping.
  - **Collision Color:** This highlights baseparts in gray, meshes in green, unions in cyan, hull-collision unions in a darker blue, sloped parts purple and unanchored parts orange.
  - **HRP-Based Character:** This allows you to see where your collision is at all times, ignoring animations.
  - **Union Decomposition:** Union decomposition checks to see the internal hitboxes of a union, showing where can be wallhopped or where has collision.  Data can only be gathered through exploits.
