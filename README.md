# FE2TAS - Game

This project is an open-source recreation inspired by the Roblox game [Flood Escape 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/586645082/Flood-Escape-2) and [8y8x's FE2CM Sandbox map](https://youtu.be/pTBZKNg4k8g). Developed with [Roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/) and [Rojo](https://rojo.space/), it is a game revolving around **Tool Assisted Speedrunning** designed to bring back the popular TAS scripts from 2022.

### Collision Features
- **Fully sandboxed:** By the map being 'fully sandbox', it allows for full eventscript/eventstring/timelines emulation.
- **Cloud saving:** This allows for a lot less downtime, as it doesn't rely on Roblox's unreliable datastore to store TAS runs, and allows for easy run sharing.
- **Full Physics:** This game fully and accurately recreates the older Flood Escape 2 physics, allowing for backjumping and wallhopping.
- **Collision Color:** Highlights baseparts in gray, meshes in green, unions in cyan, hull-collision unions in a darker blue, sloped parts purple, and unanchored parts orange.
- **HRP-Based Character:** Enables you to see where your collision is at all times, ignoring animations.
- **Union Decomposition:** Analyzes the internal hitboxes of a union, showing areas for wallhopping or collision. >(Note: Data can only be gathered through exploits.)
